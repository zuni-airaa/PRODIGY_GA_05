# PRODIGY_GA_05

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Neural Style Transfer**, a deep learning technique that applies the artistic style of one image (e.g., a famous painting) to the content of another image (e.g., a photograph). By leveraging a pretrained convolutional neural network (VGG19), the model extracts content and style representations and blends them into a stylized output.

## Features
- Apply the artistic style of one image to another  
- Use pretrained VGG19 for feature extraction  
- Gram matrix computation for style representation  
- Save and visualize stylized outputs  
- Beginner‑friendly, reproducible Colab notebook

Example Usage
python
content_image = load_img("path/to/content.jpg")
style_image = load_img("path/to/style.jpg")

stylized_image = run_style_transfer(content_image, style_image)
stylized_image.save("results/style_transfer_output.png")
Results
Here are some example outputs generated by applying artistic styles:

Content: Cityscape

Style: Van Gogh’s Starry Night

Output: Cityscape painted in Van Gogh’s style

Sample outputs are stored in the results/ folder for reference.
